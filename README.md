# A short intro to Rust basics

Check out the entry-point `./src/lib.rs`.
This code mostly makes sense while being presented,
but the comments explain it somehow.
It is mostly a bad copy of the awesome post
https://fasterthanli.me/articles/a-half-hour-to-learn-rust
so please read that instead. It is better written and more
comprehensive.
